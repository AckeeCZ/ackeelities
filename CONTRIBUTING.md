# CONTRIBUTING
We use this library to share some common utilities across our projects, so we are opinionated about
what we want to have in the library. However, if you think that you have something useful
that could be added to the library, feel free to open an issue.

## PR
Before submitting a PR, please make sure that:
- You added tests that cover your changes.
- You ran `./gradlew preMergeRequestCheck` preflight checks and all passed.
