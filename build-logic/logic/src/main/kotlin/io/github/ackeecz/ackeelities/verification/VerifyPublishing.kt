/**
 * Verifies that all dependencies between [Project] being checked and its dependent artifacts are
 * compatible and can be safely published. This includes checking if current project
 * changed and increased its version, if it has dependent modules. At the same time it checks if
 * the dependent modules increased their versions as well, so everything is properly updated once
 * released and there are no incompatible dependencies in upcoming published artifacts. This is
 * especially important for internal modules that do not have stable API, can contain breaking
 * changes and for example if they were released without all dependent artifacts being updated and
 * released as well, this could break compatibility for the library client at runtime, because there
 * could be a newer version of the internal artifact and older versions of all or some of the dependent
 * ones, causing runtime inconsistencies and crashes.
 *
 * Uses tag retrieved from [GetPreviousTag], because this task is mainly meant to be run on CI
 * during publishing process to verify publishing and it is needed to check the previous version
 * tag, because the current one (the latest) is the one that triggered the current process of releasing
 * a new version.
